\section{Abstract}
We present our experience in designing a course of Introduction to Information Technology (IIT) 
for the first-year students. The main purpose of this course is to introduce the concepts of 
computing and computer, and to present a hierarchy of information technology (IT) knowledge 
from basic to advance through the introduction of syllabus system, research trends of our faculty, 
IT applications in society, ethics and career potentials in IT. The content of this course is set up 
to meet the Standard 4 in CDIO. We divide the introduction into two courses and teach the firstyear students in the first and second semesters. The first course is the introduction of computer, 
computing, internet, ethics, and some technical skills of analysis, design, implementation, and 
testing. This is an overview of IT from the outsiders. The second is a hierarchy of IT knowledge 
from basic to advance through education systems and research in our faculty. This is an 
overview of IT from inside viewpoint. We also present some experiences about the projectbased approach for labs and explain how we train personal skills and professional attitude for 
our students. Finally, we conclude by providing comments with pros and cons in operating the
courses.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
In CDIO standard, the standard 4 [1] plays an important role to provide a general view about 
curriculum, syllabus system, future career and beginning concepts of CDIO for the first-year 
students in our university. Many similar works in engineering have been published in the CDIO 
conference. Ramon Bragós, et. al. [2], presented a method that they have conceived, designed 
and implemented "Introduction to Engineering" course at Telecom BCN, UPC, Barcelona using 
the CDIO syllabus and standards. The basic concepts and professional skills were given to the 
students through lessons and simple projects. From that, the students were able to recognize
problems of which solutions we were going to teach in the following courses of the curriculum.
Yingzi Wang, et. al. [3], introduced the implementation of the cornerstone project. They 
transformed the name of “Introduction to Civil Engineering” into “Introduction to Civil Engineering 
Design”. The difference is that students are put into an environment where they could learn and 
use knowledge and professional skills to study design actively. Xiaohua Lu, et.al. [4], introduced 
one approach of multi-disciplinary project for the introduction course. In his class, the students 
were divided into different disciplinary groups and joined in project-based learning. That project 
required students to design and build a computer-controlled tower crane at Shantou University. 
This process helped students to understand the different modules and the input/output of each 
module. As a result, the multi-disciplinary project is a good approach to introduction courses.
Proceedings of the 9th International CDIO Conference, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University 
Goran Gustafsson, et. al. [5], presented his work of engineering education programs. The firstyear introductory course was discussed and shared to improve and increase student motivation. 
They have identified projects and teamwork as important parts of the first-year courses. With the 
CDIO approach, a new model for engineering education is developed to be able to implement 
this projects and professional skills. In many previous works, we rarely see the first-year 
introductory course to information technology (IT). In this paper, we present our experience in 
designing a course of Introduction to Information Technology (IIT) for the first-year students. On 
one hand, the main purpose of this course is to introduce the concepts of computing and 
computer, and to present a hierarchy of IT knowledge from basic to advance through the 
introduction of syllabus system, research trends of our faculty, IT applications in society, ethics 
and career potentials in IT. On the other hand, the purpose of this course will introduce the 
relationship between the contents of 4 year learning in the university with IT career after 
graduation to first-year students. The IIT course also shows students the social requirements to 
IT not only in Vietnam but also worldwide. After studying this course, the first-year student will 
have another point of view about their role in the development of IT. From that starting point, it 
will help students to think and navigate their future career in IT. It also influences to students’
decision in course selections for undergraduate program at the current time or their intention to 
enter the graduate program in the future. This course will also help the students to identify the 
importance of engineering skills and appropriate attitudes for the success in their future career 
path. From the above motivation, the design and implementation of this course have been 
considered seriously by our senior lecturers and professors in our faculty. We have already 
spent more than one year to prepare the learning outcome, syllabus, teaching/learning
documents, and workspace for this course [6]. This paper will present our experiences in design, 
building, teaching, and evaluation of this course to the first-year students in 2012.
The content of this paper is presented as follows; Section 2 presents the design and building of 
course goals and learning outcomes for IIT course. Section 3 presents the approach of projectbased learning to embed CDIO concepts in teaching and training for students. Section 4 
presents the meeting and feedback between IT companies and the first-year students. Section 5 
presents the assessments and some rubrics for this course. Section 6 is our discussions about 
pros and cons in operating this course at our faculty. Section 7 is the conclusions.
